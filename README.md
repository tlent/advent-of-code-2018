# Advent of Code 2018

My solutions for Advent of Code 2018 in Rust.

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. [Learn more](https://adventofcode.com/2018/about)

I am not trying to complete the problems quickly to get a spot on the leaderboard. My focus is on writing clean and (reasonably) efficient solutions and learning more about Rust along the way.

My solutions are in the solutions directory and organized by day. Each directory has a Cargo project with my solutions. Each problem has two parts, but my solutions to both parts are in the same Cargo project.
